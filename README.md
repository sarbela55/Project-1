# Project-plan
This repository will hold the plan for my upcoming project.

I don't currently have a lock on my door, and with the open floorplan of my house, I find it hard to get any privacy a lot of the time.
In this project, I hope to create a automated door lock that will be able to be controlled at a distance, by a bluetooth remote or something of that sort.
